# Accounts: Welcome to the Memeconomy

**A new account system for a new memechain era.** Forget traditional wallets; we’re redefining how you hold your memes.

## The Master Key: Your Holy Grail

Your account begins with a **master key** derived from a minimum of **13 recovery words**. This is your treasure map—**guard it like your meme stash depends on it (because it does)**. Lose it, and not even the dankest memes can help you recover your account.

## Account Structure

- **Accounts Over Wallets:** Each account is a fortress capable of holding multiple addresses.
- **Address Generation:** Addresses are created using:
  - **x25519 Key Pairs**: Secured by a seed for ultimate recoverability.
  - **Kyber Encryption**: Future-proof and ready for E2E platforms.
- **Standalone Mode:** Addresses can be exported and used independently, making them perfect for **nodes** or other special cases.

## Security Features

- **Wallet Encryption:** Wallet files are encrypted with a password because memes aren’t the only thing worth protecting.
- **Second Layer of Security:** It’s the combo of your **master key and seed** that makes your account a fortress. Breaking the master key alone isn’t enough to access the entire account.

## Token & Asset Management

- **Unified Storage:** All tokens and assets are stored directly in addresses. No need for additional layers of complexity.
- **Cross-Compatible:** Use addresses across the memechain with no fuss. Simplicity is key in a world of chaos.

## Why It’s Better

Traditional wallets? Overrated. Our account system is like an exclusive VIP pass to the **memeconomy**—secure, scalable, and oh-so-satisfying. 

> **Pro Tip:** Write your 13+ words on paper, stone tablets, or tattoo them (not really, but you get the idea). Losing them equals permanent FOMO.
