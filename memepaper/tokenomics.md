# MEMENATION Token: The First MemeToken (MT) Based

**Let's get memed!** This is the perfect token for the NUMERABLE memechain. High yields, no limits, and enough insanity to make you question reality.

## Overview

Here’s the juicy scoop about MEMENATION (MENA):

- **Total Supply at Genesis:** 130 billion tokens
- **Distribution:**
  - Most tokens are **airdropped** to early memers
  - No transaction fees. Ever. Seriously, it’s free!
- **Locking & Yield:**
  - Nodes and users can **lock accounts** to earn interest.
  - Interests are calculated exponentially, starting low and climbing day by day over the year.
- **Decimals:** 13
- **No Max Supply:** Tokens for everyone, forever.

## Inflation Mechanics

The token’s inflation is designed to reward early adopters and stabilize over time. Here’s how it works:

| **Node Yield**  | Year 1: 100% | Year 2: 75% | Year 3: 30% | Year 4: 13% |
|------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **User Yield**  | Year 1: 100% | Year 2: 50% | Year 3: 20% | Year 4: 9%  |

*These inflation rates are high at first to give early memers maximum rewards, eventually stabilizing to an acceptable level after 4 years.*

## Locking Accounts

Locking accounts is where the real meme magic happens. Here’s the breakdown:

- **Duration:** Accounts must be locked for **1 year**. Early unlocking is allowed but comes with penalties:
  - **10% penalty** on the first day, decreasing daily to **0.1%** on the last day.
- **Withdrawal Mechanics:**
  - Interest withdrawals are always free and can occur at any time during the lock period.
  - Withdrawals during the locking period send funds to the secondary wallet used during the lock request and are calculated daily.
- **Interest:**
  - All interest is minted at the time of withdrawal.
  - Calculated exponentially: starts small, grows big, rewards patience.
- **Restrictions:** Locked accounts cannot send or receive funds during the lock period.
- **Requirement:** All operations (locking, unlocking, withdrawing) must be requested with a signature from a **secondary address**, and withdrawals will always go to the address registered during the locking process.

## On-Chain Awesomeness

- All essential metadata, including **name**, **ticker**, **image**, and other necessary information, will be stored on-chain. Because what’s a memechain without its bling?
- Additionally, the **Lua scripts**, token data progression, and the entire lifecycle of the token will be stored entirely on-chain, ensuring everything is transparent and decentralized.

## Governance & Script Standards

- **No Owner Privileges:** There’s no centralized control here. Founder nodes can **vote to edit scripts** if needed.
- **Standards:**
  - **MemeToken (MT):** The OG token standard.
  - **MemeAsset (MA):** The next evolution.

***Note:** This isn’t just a token. It’s a lifestyle. It’s a movement. It’s a meme.*
